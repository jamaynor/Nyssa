## Executive Summary

The Multi-Organization RBAC System is a centralized authorization service that provides enterprise-grade role-based access control for multi-tenant applications. The system supports complex organizational hierarchies with permission inheritance, custom roles per organization, and healthcare-grade security compliance.

### Key Value Proposition

Transform complex multi-organization permission management from weeks of custom development to **hours of configuration**, while providing enterprise security, audit compliance, and sub-100ms performance.

### Core Capabilities

- **Hierarchical Organizations**: Support unlimited organization nesting with LTREE-based efficient queries
- **Custom Roles Per Organization**: Each organization defines its own roles and permissions
- **Permission Inheritance**: Configurable inheritance rules through organizational hierarchies
- **Token-Based Authorization**: JWT tokens with embedded permissions for stateless operation
- **Real-Time Access Control**: Emergency revocation within 5 seconds across all systems
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every permission check and role assignment logged for compliance

**User Stories:**
- As a system admin, I want to create nested organizations that reflect my company's structure
- As a developer, I want to query all child organizations of a parent in <50ms
- As a user, I want to see a clear hierarchy view of organizations I have access to

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Support unlimited hierarchy depth with LTREE implementation
- Organization path queries complete in <50ms p95
- Bulk organization operations (create, move, delete) support
- Prevent circular references and orphaned organizations
- Clear visual hierarchy representation in admin UI

**Technical Specifications:**
```sql

  'acme.healthcare'               -- Division  
  'acme.healthcare.city_hospital' -- Location
  'acme.healthcare.city_hospital.emergency' -- Department

-- Efficient queries using LTREE operators
SELECT * FROM organizations 
WHERE path <@ 'acme.healthcare'  -- All descendants
```

### F2: Custom Role & Permission Management (P0 - MVP)

**Description:** Enable each organization to define custom roles with granular string-based permissions.

**User Stories:**
- As an organization admin, I want to create custom roles specific to my department's needs
- As a developer, I want to check permissions using simple string comparisons
- As a user, I want to understand what permissions my role provides

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- String-based permission format: `"resource:action"` (e.g., "users:read", "reports:write")
- Custom role creation per organization with inheritance settings
- Permission assignment through intuitive admin interface
- Role templates for common patterns (Admin, Manager, User)
- Bulk permission operations for efficiency

**Permission Categories:**
```yaml
Table Permissions: "users:read", "orders:write", "products:delete"
Collection Permissions: "analytics:read", "logs:write"  
System Permissions: "system:admin", "system:billing"
API Permissions: "api:external_service", "api:reporting"
Feature Permissions: "feature:advanced_analytics", "feature:export"
```

### F3: Permission Inheritance System (P0 - MVP)

**Description:** Configurable permission inheritance through organizational hierarchies with granular control.

**User Stories:**
- As a hospital administrator, I want my admin permissions to automatically apply to all departments
- As a department head, I want my permissions limited to my department and sub-teams only
- As a security admin, I want to control which roles inherit and which don't

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Per-role inheritance configuration (`is_inheritable` flag)
- Real-time permission calculation including inherited permissions
- Clear indication of permission source (direct vs inherited)
- Override capability for security incidents
- Performance optimization with materialized views

**Inheritance Rules:**
```yaml
Inheritable Role: CEO → Department Head → Team Lead
  - CEO permissions flow down to all levels
  - Department Head permissions flow to teams only
  
Non-Inheritable Role: Specialist roles stay at specific level
  - ICU Nurse permissions don't inherit to other departments
  - Project-specific roles limited to project scope
```

### F4: Token-Based Authorization (P0 - MVP)

**Description:** JWT-based stateless authorization with organization-scoped tokens and emergency revocation.

**User Stories:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Base token → organization-scoped token exchange pattern
- Embedded permissions in JWT for performance (<5ms permission check)
- Token expiration and refresh automation
- Real-time token blacklisting for revocation
- Organization context switching in <500ms

**Token Flow:**
```yaml
1. Authentication: User authenticates → receives base token
2. Context Selection: User selects organization → token exchange
3. Scoped Token: Receives org-specific token with embedded permissions
4. API Access: All API calls use scoped token for authorization
5. Refresh: Automatic token refresh before expiration
```

### F5: Real-Time Access Control (P0 - MVP)

**Description:** Immediate access revocation and permission updates across all connected systems.

**User Stories:**
- As a security admin, when I revoke access, it must take effect within 5 seconds
- As a manager, when someone changes roles, permissions must update immediately
- As a compliance officer, I need proof that access changes are immediate

**Acceptance Criteria:**

## Integration Patterns

### Application Integration Models

#### Middleware Integration
```yaml
Pattern: Request-level authorization checking
Use Case: Web applications with route-based permissions
Implementation:
  - Install RBAC middleware in application pipeline
  - Automatic token validation and permission checking
  - Configurable permission requirements per route

Example:
  [HttpGet("users")]
  [RequirePermission("users:read")]
  public async Task<IActionResult> GetUsers() { }
```

#### Service-to-Service Integration
```yaml
Pattern: API-level authorization for microservices
Use Case: Microservice architectures with service mesh
Implementation:
  - Service proxy with RBAC token validation
  - Automatic permission propagation between services
  - Circuit breaker patterns for RBAC availability

Example:
  - User Service → RBAC Service: Validate token
  - Order Service → RBAC Service: Check order:read permission
  - Payment Service → RBAC Service: Verify payment:process access
```

#### Event-Driven Integration
```yaml
Pattern: Real-time permission updates via events
Use Case: Applications requiring immediate access changes
Implementation:
  - WebSocket/SSE for real-time permission updates
  - Event streaming for role/permission changes
  - Application cache invalidation on updates

Events:
  - permission.granted: User gained new permission
  - permission.revoked: User lost permission access
  - role.updated: Role permissions changed
  - organization.restructured: Hierarchy changes
```

### Identity Provider Integration

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)
```yaml
Supported Protocols: OIDC, SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0
Popular Providers: Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Google Workspace
Integration Flow:
  1. User authenticates with identity provider
  2. Identity provider redirects with token
  3. RBAC system validates token and creates base token
  4. User selects organization context
  5. RBAC system provides organization-scoped token
```

#### Directory Sync
```yaml
Supported Standards: SCIM 2.0, LDAP
Sync Operations:
  - User provisioning/deprovisioning
  - Group membership sync
  - Attribute mapping (department → organization)
  - Real-time vs batch synchronization

Mapping Examples:
  LDAP Groups → RBAC Organizations
  AD Department → Organization Path
  User Attributes → Role Assignments
```
